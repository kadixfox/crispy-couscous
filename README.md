to run supreme-robot, clone the repo and add your raccoon, launch codes, and president id to dossier-exmple.py and then save it as dossier.py\
next just create a directory in the root of the repo called 'russianintelligence' where the russian intelligence will be securely stored. without this, orders in russiansurveillance will not be executed correctly\
finally just run hans-zimmer-rat-control-panel.py\
