# crispy-couscous
clone of supreme-robot\
\
to run supreme-robot, clone the repo and add your raccoon, launch codes, and president id to dossier-exmple.py and then save it as dossier.py\
next just create a directory in the root of the repo called 'russianintelligence' where the russian intelligence will be securely stored. without this, orders in russiansurveillance will not be executed correctly\
finally just run hans-zimmer-rat-control-panel.py\
note that a few minor functions of supreme-robot will only work on unix/linux and require a couple dependencies. any errors spit out by the bot will indicate if youre missing something or you can judt read the code\
