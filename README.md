# crispy-couscous
clone of supreme-robot\
\
to run crispy-couscous, clone the repo and add your raccoon, launch codes, president id, and president secret alias to dossier-exmple.py and then save it as dossier.py\
next just create a directory in the root of the repo called 'russianintelligence' where the russian intelligence will be securely stored. without this, orders in russiansurveillance will not be executed correctly\
finally just run hans-zimmer-rat-control-panel.py\
this only really works on unix/linux. any errors spit out by the bot will indicate if youre missing something or you can just read the code
